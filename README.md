This board and associated samplecode is meant to be used with the PICKit3 programming interface with 
the PIC24 on the LuckyPIC board. The board itself contains the following hardware:

1. 2.0/2.1mm DC Barrel jack with REG1117 +5V regulator
2. Push button 
3. 2x ADS1286U with BNC connectors
4. 16 MHz crystal oscillator
5. 8x LEDs (4 blue, 4 orange)
6. SPST DIP switch (4-position)
7. PICKit programming interface pins
8. Pins for 16-pin LED display
9. PIC24FJ64GA004 microcontroller
